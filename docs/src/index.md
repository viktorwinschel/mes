# Monetary Macro Accounting with Memory Evolutive Systems

Welcome to the documentation of MoMa (Monetary Macro Accounting) implemented using Memory Evolutive Systems (MES)! This package provides tools for modeling monetary and economic systems using category theory and memory evolutive systems.

## Overview

This project combines two powerful frameworks:

1. **MoMa (Monetary Macro Accounting)**: A framework for modeling monetary and economic systems, focusing on:
   - Double-entry bookkeeping at micro and macro levels
   - Flow-of-funds analysis
   - National accounting principles
   - Financial instrument modeling

2. **MES (Memory Evolutive Systems)**: A mathematical framework that:
   - Uses category theory to model complex systems
   - Represents systems that evolve over time
   - Maintains structural relationships and memory
   - Provides rigorous mathematical foundations

The combination allows us to model economic systems with both mathematical rigor and practical applicability.

## Quick Start

To get started with MoMa and MES:

1. Check out the [Getting Started](getting_started/index.md) guide
2. Explore the [Theory](theory.md) section
3. Try the examples:
   - [Bill of Exchange](examples/boe_cycles.md) for financial instruments
   - [National Accounting](examples/national_accounting.md) for macro systems
4. Reference the [API Documentation](api.md)
