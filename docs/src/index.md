# Memory Evolutive Systems

Welcome to the Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) documentation! This package provides tools for modeling complex systems using category theory and memory evolutive systems.

## Overview

Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) are mathematical models that combine category theory with dynamical systems to represent complex systems that evolve over time while maintaining structural relationships and memory. This implementation focuses on economic and financial applications.

## Quick Start

To get started with MES:

1. Check out the [Getting Started](getting_started/index.md) guide
2. Explore the [Theory](theory/index.md) section
3. Try the [Examples](examples/index.md)
4. Reference the [API Documentation](api.md)
