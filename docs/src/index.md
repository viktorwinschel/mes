# MoMaT_Sim Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for MoMaT_Sim, a Julia package for simulating Memory Evolutive Systems.

## Overview

MoMaT_Sim provides tools for:
- Creating and manipulating categories
- Working with patterns and colimits
- Simulating memory evolutive systems

## Getting Started

- [Installation](getting_started/installation.md)
- [Basic Usage](getting_started/basic_usage.md)

## Examples

Check out the [Examples](examples/basic_categories.md) section for practical demonstrations.

## Theory

Learn about the mathematical foundations in the [Theory](theory/categories.md) section.

## API Reference

Browse the [API Reference](api.md) for detailed function documentation.

## Mathematical Background

Memory Evolutive Systems are based on category theory and include:

1. **Categories and Functors**
   - Objects and morphisms
   - Functorial evolution
   - Composition rules

2. **Patterns and Colimits**
   - Pattern recognition
   - Colimit computation
   - Emergence of new objects

3. **Memory Systems**
   - Short-term and long-term memory
   - Co-regulators
   - Synchronization
