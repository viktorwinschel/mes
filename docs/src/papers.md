This paper develops a specification for macro accounting (MoMa) and a monetary macro accounting theory (MoMaT) where:
- Money functions as a medium of payment for obligations and debts
- Addresses temporal misalignment in production processes
- Operates at three interconnected levels:
  * Micro level: facilitating division of labor
  * Meso level: enabling risk sharing in banking
  * Macro level: governing GDP distribution through money issuance
- Uses Bills of Exchange (BoE) as a unifying instrument
- Provides mathematical foundations through sheaf theory
- Implements computation using open games
- Applies to monetary policy and supply chain finance
