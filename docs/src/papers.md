- Applies category theory to model biological, social, and cognitive systems
- Addresses key problems in complexity theory:
  * The binding problem
  * The emergence problem
  * The hierarchy problem
- Introduces concepts of self-regulation and co-regulators
- Provides applications to cognitive systems and consciousness

### Monetary Macro Accounting Theory (MoMaT)
**Authors**: Dr. Renée Menéndez and Dr. Viktor Winschel  
**Journal**: Blockchain Economics: Implications of Distributed Ledgers  
**DOI**: [Forthcoming]  
**PDF**: [Download MOMAT Paper](assets/papers/bcbaas25.pdf)

This paper develops a specification for macro accounting (MoMa) and a monetary macro accounting theory (MoMaT) where:
- Money functions as a medium of payment for obligations and debts
- Addresses temporal misalignment in production processes
- Operates at three interconnected levels:
  * Micro level: facilitating division of labor
  * Meso level: enabling risk sharing in banking
  * Macro level: governing GDP distribution through money issuance
- Uses Bills of Exchange (BoE) as a unifying instrument
- Provides mathematical foundations through sheaf theory
- Implements computation using open games
- Applies to monetary policy and supply chain finance

## Future Directions

Extensions of MoMa and MES as DSLs for:
1. national accounting, moneay theory and policy and exchange rate regimes
2. platform of digital bill of exchange products for supply chains
3. virtual power plant and quartier operating systems
4. liuqidity management of a holding of windparks
