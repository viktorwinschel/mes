# Patterns

## Basic Concepts

A pattern is a diagram in a category that represents a specific structure or relationship.

In MES, patterns are represented by the `Pattern` type:

```julia
struct Pattern
    objects::Vector{String}
    morphisms::Dict{String, Tuple{String, String}}
    source::Category
    target::Category
end
```

## Properties

1. **Objects**: The objects involved in the pattern
2. **Morphisms**: The relationships between pattern objects
3. **Source**: The category containing the pattern
4. **Target**: The category resulting from the pattern

## Applications in MES

Patterns are used to model:
- Transaction sequences
- Value transformations
- Time evolution
- Complex financial operations
