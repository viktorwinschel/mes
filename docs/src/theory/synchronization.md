# Synchronization Theory

This page explains the theoretical foundations of synchronization in Memory Evolutive Systems.

## Overview

Synchronization in MES refers to the coordinated behavior of system components through their interactions. This coordination can occur at multiple levels and through various mechanisms.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Oscillator Networks

Oscillator networks are fundamental building blocks for modeling synchronization in MES:

- Each oscillator has a phase and frequency
- Oscillators interact through coupling connections
- The network topology determines synchronization patterns

### 2. Phase Locking

Phase locking occurs when oscillators maintain a constant phase difference:

- Strong coupling leads to complete synchronization
- Weak coupling may result in partial synchronization
- Phase locking values measure synchronization strength

### 3. Co-regulation

Co-regulation mechanisms enable system components to:

- Maintain stable states
- Respond to external perturbations
- Adapt to changing conditions

### 4. Entrainment

Entrainment describes how oscillators influence each other:

- Driver oscillators can entrain responder oscillators
- The strength of entrainment depends on coupling
- Frequency differences affect entrainment stability

## Mathematical Framework

### Phase Dynamics

The phase evolution of coupled oscillators follows:

```math
\frac{d\phi_i}{dt} = \omega_i + \sum_{j=1}^N K_{ij} \sin(\phi_j - \phi_i)
```

where:
- $\phi_i$ is the phase of oscillator i
- $\omega_i$ is the natural frequency
- $K_{ij}$ is the coupling strength

### Synchronization Order Parameter

The order parameter measures global synchronization:

```math
R = \left|\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\phi_j}\right|
```

### Co-regulation Equations

The co-regulation dynamics are described by:

```math
\frac{dx_i}{dt} = f_i(x_i) + \sum_{j=1}^N g_{ij}(x_i, x_j)
```
