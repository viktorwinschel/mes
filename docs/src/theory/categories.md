# Categories

## Basic Concepts

A category consists of objects and morphisms between them, satisfying certain properties.

In MES, categories are represented by the `Category` type:

```julia
struct Category
    objects::Vector{String}
    morphisms::Dict{String, Tuple{String, String}}
end
```

## Properties

1. **Objects**: The basic elements in the category
2. **Morphisms**: The relationships between objects
3. **Composition**: The way morphisms combine
4. **Identity**: Special morphisms from an object to itself

## Applications in MES

Categories are used to model:
- Financial accounts and their relationships
- Transaction flows
- Value transformations
- Time evolution
