# Category Theory in Memory Evolutive Systems

This section introduces the fundamental concepts of category theory as used in Memory Evolutive Systems.

## Basic Definitions

### Category

A category \( \mathcal{C} \) consists of:
- A collection of objects
- A collection of morphisms between objects
- A composition operation for morphisms

In MoMaT_Sim, categories are represented by the `Category` type:

```julia
struct Category{T}
    objects::Vector{T}
    morphisms::Dict{Tuple{T,T},Vector{T}}
    composition::Dict{Tuple{T,T,T},Bool}
end
```

### Pattern

A pattern \( P \) in a category \( \mathcal{C} \) consists of:
- A collection of objects from \( \mathcal{C} \)
- A collection of morphisms between these objects

In MoMaT_Sim, patterns are represented by the `Pattern` type:

```julia
struct Pattern{T}
    category::Category{T}
    objects::Vector{T}
    links::Vector{Tuple{T,T}}
end
```

## Colimits

The colimit of a pattern \( P \) represents the "gluing together" of the objects in the pattern along their morphisms. This is a fundamental operation in Memory Evolutive Systems, used to represent:

- Object formation through binding
- Complex object construction
- Memory formation
