# MES Constructions in MOMA BOE Events

## 1. BOE Creation Event

### Memory Generation
When a BOE is created between Banks A and B:

```julia
event = Dict(
    "type" => "create_boe",
    "from" => "Banks",
    "to" => "Bankb",
    "amount" => 100.0
)
```

Memory generates:
1. **Micro Level** (Individual accounts):
   ```math
   \begin{array}{rcl}
   Bank A & : & Receivable = 100 \\
   Bank B & : & Liability = 100
   \end{array}
   ```

2. **Pattern Level** (Complex links):
   ```julia
   pattern = MoneyPattern(
       [bank_a.accounts["Receivable from BOE"],
        bank_b.accounts["Liability from BOE"]],
       "Bills of Exchange",
       "BOE Creation"
   )
   ```

3. **Macro Level** (Emergent money):
   ```math
   BOE_{total} = BOE_{total} + 100
   ```

### Classifier Operation
The BOE creation is validated by multiple classifiers:

1. **Basic Balance** (C₁):
   ```math
   C_1(a) = debit(a) = credit(a)
   ```

2. **Relationship Invariance** (C₂):
   ```math
   C_2(boe) = receivable(boe) = liability(boe)
   ```

3. **System Invariance** (C₃):
   ```math
   C_3(sys) = \sum receivables = \sum liabilities
   ```

## 2. BOE Transfer Event

### Memory Evolution
When Bank B transfers BOE to Bank C:

```julia
event = Dict(
    "type" => "transfer_boe",
    "from" => "Bankb",
    "to" => "Bankc",
    "amount" => 100.0
)
```

Memory evolves through:
1. **State Change**:
   ```math
   \begin{array}{rcl}
   Before & : & A \to B(100) \\
   After & : & A \to C(100)
   \end{array}
   ```

2. **Pattern Evolution**:
   - Old pattern (A→B) is replaced by new pattern (A→C)
   - Macro money amount remains unchanged

### Complex Links
Transfer can occur through multiple paths:

1. **Direct Transfer**:
   ```julia
   P₁ = [
       update_account!(bankb, "Liability from BOE", -100),
       update_account!(bankc, "Liability from BOE", +100)
   ]
   ```

2. **CB Clearing**:
   ```julia
   P₂ = [
       update_account!(bankb, "CB Reserve", -100),
       update_account!(bankc, "CB Reserve", +100),
       update_account!(bankb, "Liability from BOE", -100),
       update_account!(bankc, "Liability from BOE", +100)
   ]
   ```

Both paths P₁ and P₂ yield same macro state (A→C relationship).

## 3. BOE Settlement Event

### Fracture Resolution
When settling the BOE:

```julia
event = Dict(
    "type" => "settle_boe",
    "from" => "Banks",
    "to" => "Bankc",
    "amount" => 100.0
)
```

1. **Fracture Detection**:
   ```julia
   fracture = Dict(
       "type" => "BOE",
       "accounts" => ["Receivable from BOE", "Liability from BOE"],
       "amount" => 100.0
   )
   ```

2. **Resynchronization**:
   ```julia
   # Clear BOE accounts
   update_account!(banks, "Receivable from BOE", -100)
   update_account!(bankc, "Liability from BOE", -100)
   
   # Settle through reserves
   update_account!(banks, "CB Reserve", -100)
   update_account!(bankc, "CB Reserve", +100)
   ```

### Memory Cleanup
After settlement:
1. BOE pattern is removed
2. Money supply is reduced
3. System returns to coherent state

## 4. Emergence Through BOE Lifecycle

### Money Creation
1. **Micro Level**: Individual account entries
   ```
   Bank A (DR) | Bank B (CR) | Bank C (CR)
   100         | 100 → 0     | 0 → 100
   ```

2. **Macro Level**: Emergent money property
   ```
   Total BOE Money = 100 (constant through transfer)
   Total BOE Money = 0 (after settlement)
   ```

### Pattern Evolution
1. **Creation**: A→B pattern emerges
2. **Transfer**: Pattern evolves to A→C
3. **Settlement**: Pattern dissolves

### Invariance Maintenance
Throughout lifecycle:
1. Claims = Liabilities (always)
2. Money supply constant until settlement
3. System coherence maintained

## 5. Implementation Details

### Key Functions
```julia
# Memory generation
function create_boe(landscape, from, to, amount)
    # Generate micro entries
    # Create pattern
    # Verify through classifiers
end

# Pattern evolution
function transfer_boe(landscape, boe, new_holder)
    # Update pattern
    # Maintain invariance
    # Generate new relationships
end

# Fracture resolution
function settle_boe(landscape, boe)
    # Clear BOE accounts
    # Process settlement
    # Remove pattern
end
```

### Classifier Chain
```julia
function verify_boe_transaction(event)
    # C₁: Account balance
    basic_valid = verify_account_balance(event)
    
    # C₂: Relationship validity
    if basic_valid
        relationship_valid = verify_boe_relationship(event)
        
        # C₃: System coherence
        if relationship_valid
            return verify_system_state(event)
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This shows how:
1. Memory actively generates and evolves BOE data
2. Classifiers ensure valid BOE operations
3. Complex links enable BOE transfers
4. Fractures trigger BOE settlement
5. Money emerges through BOE patterns
