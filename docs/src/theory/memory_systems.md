# Memory Systems

## Basic Concepts

Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) are based on the following principles:

1. **Categories and Functors**
   - Objects and morphisms
   - Functorial evolution
   - Composition rules

2. **Patterns and Colimits**
   - Pattern recognition
   - Colimit computation
   - Emergence of new objects

3. **Memory Systems**
   - Short-term and long-term memory
   - Co-regulators
   - Synchronization

## Applications in Financial Systems

Memory systems are used to model:
- Transaction history
- Value evolution
- Time-dependent operations
- Complex financial relationships
