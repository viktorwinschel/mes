# Theory

This section covers the mathematical foundations of MES.

## Categories

A category consists of objects and morphisms between them, satisfying certain properties.

In MES, categories are represented by the `Category` type:

```julia
struct Category
    objects::Vector{String}
    morphisms::Vector{Tuple{String, String, String}}  # (source, target, name)
end
```

### Basic Operations

```julia
# Create a category
cat = create_category([
    ("A", "B", "f"),
    ("B", "C", "g")
])

# Verify category properties
is_valid = verify_category(cat)
```

### Mathematical Definition

A category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of:
- A collection of objects: $\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$
- A collection of morphisms: $\text{Hom}(\mathcal{C})$
- Composition operation: $\circ: \text{Hom}(B,C) \times \text{Hom}(A,B) \to \text{Hom}(A,C)$
- Identity morphisms: $\text{id}_A: A \to A$

Satisfying the following axioms:

1. **Associativity**:
   $$\forall f: A \to B, g: B \to C, h: C \to D$$
   $$(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)$$

2. **Identity**:
   $$\forall f: A \to B$$
   $$f \circ \text{id}_A = f = \text{id}_B \circ f$$

## Patterns

A pattern is a diagram in a category that represents a specific structure or relationship.

In MES, patterns are represented by the `Pattern` type:

```julia
struct Pattern
    objects::Vector{String}
    morphisms::Vector{Tuple{String, String, String}}
end
```

### Pattern Operations

```julia
# Create a pattern
pattern = create_pattern([
    ("A", "B", "f")
])

# Calculate colimit
colimit = calculate_colimit(pattern)
```

### Mathematical Definition

A pattern $P$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ is defined as:
$$P = \{O_i, M_j\}$$
where:
- $O_i$ are objects in $\mathcal{C}$
- $M_j$ are morphisms between these objects

The colimit of a pattern $P$, denoted $\text{colim}(P)$, is an object $C$ together with morphisms $\varphi_i: O_i \to C$ satisfying the universal property:

$$\forall X \in \mathcal{C}, \forall \psi_i: O_i \to X \text{ such that } \psi_j \circ M_j = \psi_i$$
$$\exists! \psi: C \to X \text{ such that } \psi \circ \varphi_i = \psi_i$$

## Memory Systems

Memory Evolutive Systems extend categories with memory capabilities:

```julia
# Create a memory system
memory = create_memory_system()

# Add memory trace
add_memory_trace!(memory, "event1", "data1")

# Retrieve memory
data = retrieve_memory(memory, "event1")
```

### Mathematical Definition

A Memory Evolutive System $\mathcal{M}$ is defined as:
$$\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{C}, M, \mathcal{P})$$
where:
- $\mathcal{C}$ is a category
- $M$ is a memory system
- $\mathcal{P}$ is a set of procedures

The memory system $M$ is a function:
$$M: T \times E \to D$$
where:
- $T$ is the time domain
- $E$ is the event space
- $D$ is the data space

## Mathematical Foundations

The key mathematical concepts are expressed through:

1. Category Axioms:
```math
\forall f: A \to B, g: B \to C, h: C \to D
(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)
```

2. Pattern Recognition:
```math
P = \{O_i, M_j\} \text{ where } O_i \text{ are objects and } M_j \text{ are morphisms}
```

3. Colimit Universal Property:
```math
\forall X, \exists! \psi: C \to X \text{ such that } \psi \circ \varphi_D = \text{unique}
```

## Next Steps

Future implementations will include:
- Functorial evolution
- Complexification process
- Co-regulators
- Advanced pattern recognition
