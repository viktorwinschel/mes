# Memory Evolutive Systems Theory

This document outlines the core theoretical concepts of Memory Evolutive Systems (MES).

## Categories

A category C consists of:
- Objects: Ob(C)
- Morphisms: Hom(C)
- Composition and identity laws

## Patterns

A pattern P in a category C is a diagram consisting of:
- Objects from C
- Morphisms between these objects
- Binding relations

## Memory

The memory component M maps:
- Time T
- Events E
- Data D

## Evolution

Evolution occurs through:
1. Pattern formation
2. Binding
3. Complex formation

## Category Theory Basics

### Categories

A category \( \mathcal{C} \) consists of:
- A collection of objects
- A collection of morphisms (arrows) between objects
- A composition operation for morphisms
- Identity morphisms for each object

In our implementation, a category is represented by the `Category` type:

```julia
struct Category{T}
    objects::Vector{T}
    morphisms::Dict{Tuple{T,T},Vector{T}}
    composition::Dict{Tuple{T,T,T},Bool}
end
```

The category must satisfy several axioms:
1. **Composition Closure**: For morphisms \( f: A \to B \) and \( g: B \to C \), there exists a composition \( g \circ f: A \to C \)
2. **Associativity**: For morphisms \( f, g, h \), we have \( (h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f) \)
3. **Identity**: For each object \( A \), there exists an identity morphism \( id_A: A \to A \) such that \( f \circ id_A = f \) and \( id_A \circ g = g \)

### Patterns and Colimits

A pattern \( P \) in a category \( \mathcal{C} \) is a diagram consisting of:
- A collection of objects from \( \mathcal{C} \)
- A collection of morphisms between these objects

In our implementation:

```julia
struct Pattern
    category::Category
    objects::Vector{String}
    links::Vector{Tuple{String,String}}
end
```

A colimit of a pattern \( P \) is an object \( C \) together with morphisms from each object in the pattern to \( C \) that satisfy the universal property:
- For any other object \( D \) with morphisms from the pattern objects, there exists a unique morphism \( C \to D \) making all diagrams commute.

## Memory Systems

A Memory Evolutive System extends these categorical concepts with:

### Hierarchical Categories

A hierarchical category adds complexity levels to objects:

```julia
struct HierarchicalCategory{T}
    levels::Dict{Int,Vector{T}}
    bindings::Dict{T,Vector{T}}
    complexity::Dict{T,Int}
end
```

This structure allows us to represent:
- Objects at different complexity levels
- Bindings between levels
- Complexity measures for objects

### Memory Components

Memory components handle the storage and retrieval of information:

```julia
struct MemoryComponent{T}
    records::Vector{T}
    timestamps::Vector{DateTime}
    multiplicity::Int
    decay_rate::Float64
end
```

Key features include:
- Variable multiplicity of records
- Temporal aspects (timestamps)
- Decay of information over time

### Co-Regulators

Co-regulators manage system adaptation:

```julia
struct CoRegulator{T}
    landscape::Dict{T,Float64}
    threshold::Float64
    decay_rate::Float64
end
```

They handle:
- Activation landscapes
- Thresholds for transitions
- Decay of activation levels

## Pattern Synchronization

Pattern synchronization allows us to relate patterns in different contexts:

```julia
struct Synchronization
    source_pattern::Pattern
    target_pattern::Pattern
end
```

This enables:
- Pattern matching across contexts
- Transfer of structure between patterns
- Coordination of complex behaviors

## Mathematical Properties

The system as a whole satisfies several important properties:

1. **Emergence**: Higher-level patterns emerge from interactions at lower levels
2. **Stability**: The system maintains coherence through co-regulation
3. **Adaptability**: Memory components allow learning from experience
4. **Hierarchy**: Multiple complexity levels interact through bindings

These properties make MES suitable for modeling complex systems that:
- Develop hierarchical structures
- Learn from experience
- Adapt to changing conditions
- Maintain stability while evolving

## Applications
