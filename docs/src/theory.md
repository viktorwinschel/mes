# Theory

This section covers the mathematical foundations of MES.

## Categories

A category consists of objects and morphisms between them, satisfying certain properties.

In MES, categories are represented by the `Category` type:

```julia
struct Category
    objects::Vector{String}
    morphisms::Vector{Tuple{String, String, String}}  # (source, target, name)
end
```

### Basic Operations

```julia
# Create a category
cat = create_category([
    ("A", "B", "f"),
    ("B", "C", "g")
])

# Verify category properties
is_valid = verify_category(cat)
```

## Patterns

A pattern is a diagram in a category that represents a specific structure or relationship.

In MES, patterns are represented by the `Pattern` type:

```julia
struct Pattern
    objects::Vector{String}
    morphisms::Vector{Tuple{String, String, String}}
end
```

### Pattern Operations

```julia
# Create a pattern
pattern = create_pattern([
    ("A", "B", "f")
])

# Calculate colimit
colimit = calculate_colimit(pattern)
```

## Memory Systems

Memory Evolutive Systems extend categories with memory capabilities:

```julia
# Create a memory system
memory = create_memory_system()

# Add memory trace
add_memory_trace!(memory, "event1", "data1")

# Retrieve memory
data = retrieve_memory(memory, "event1")
```

## Mathematical Foundations

The key mathematical concepts are expressed through:

1. Category Axioms:
```math
\forall f: A \to B, g: B \to C, h: C \to D
(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)
```

2. Pattern Recognition:
```math
P = \{O_i, M_j\} \text{ where } O_i \text{ are objects and } M_j \text{ are morphisms}
```

3. Colimit Universal Property:
```math
\forall X, \exists! \psi: C \to X \text{ such that } \psi \circ \varphi_D = \text{unique}
```

## Next Steps

Future implementations will include:
- Functorial evolution
- Complexification process
- Co-regulators
- Advanced pattern recognition
