# Theory

This section covers the mathematical foundations of MES.

## Categories

A category consists of objects and morphisms between them, satisfying certain properties.

In MES, categories are represented by the `Category` type:

```julia
struct Category
    objects::Vector{String}
    morphisms::Dict{String, Tuple{String, String}}
end
```

## Patterns

A pattern is a diagram in a category that represents a specific structure or relationship.

In MES, patterns are represented by the `Pattern` type:

```julia
struct Pattern
    objects::Vector{String}
    morphisms::Dict{String, Tuple{String, String}}
    source::Category
    target::Category
end
```

## Colimits

The colimit of a pattern \( P \) represents the "gluing together" of the objects in the pattern along their morphisms. This is a fundamental operation in Memory Evolutive Systems, used to represent:

- Object formation through binding
- Complex object construction
- Memory formation

## Memory Evolutive Systems

Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) are based on the following principles:

1. **Categories and Functors**
   - Objects and morphisms
   - Functorial evolution
   - Composition rules

2. **Patterns and Colimits**
   - Pattern recognition
   - Colimit computation
   - Emergence of new objects

3. **Memory Systems**
   - Short-term and long-term memory
   - Co-regulators
   - Synchronization

## Next Steps

```julia
hierarchical_cat = Dict(
    "levels" => levels,
    "links" => links,
    "complexity_order" => Dict()
)
```

## Complexification Process

Complexification is the process of integrating patterns into higher-order structures. Each complexification step creates new objects and morphisms:

```julia
complexified_category = Dict(
    "objects" => new_objects,
    "morphisms" => new_morphisms
)
```

## Memory Systems

Memory Evolutive Systems extend categories with:
- Procedures for processing information
- Memory states
- Co-regulators for managing system dynamics

```julia
memory_system = Dict(
    "category" => category,
    "procedures" => procedures,
    "memory_states" => Dict(),
    "co_regulators" => Dict()
)
```

## Mathematical Formulas

The key mathematical concepts are expressed through:

1. Colimit Universal Property:
```math
\forall X, \exists! \psi: C \to X \text{ such that } \psi \circ \varphi_D = \text{unique}
```

2. Functorial Evolution:
```math
F(A) = A' \quad \text{and} \quad F(f: A \to B) = f': A' \to B'
```

3. Multiplicity Principle:
```math
\exists P, Q \text{ such that } colim(P) = colim(Q)
```

4. Memory Dynamics:
```math
M_{t+1} = F(M_t, P_t)
```
