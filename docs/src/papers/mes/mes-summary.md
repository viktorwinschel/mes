# Memory Evolutive Systems Summary

This document summarizes the key concepts of Memory Evolutive Systems (MES).

## Category Structure

A category C consists of:
- Objects: Ob(C)
- Morphisms: Hom(C)
- Composition and identity laws

## Patterns

A pattern P in C is defined as:

$$
P = (O, M)
$$

where:
- O_i are objects in C
- M_i are morphisms between objects

## Memory Evolutive System

A Memory Evolutive System M is defined as:

$$
M = (C, M, P)
$$

where:
- C is a category
- M is a memory function
- P is a set of procedures

## Synchronization

A synchronization S between patterns P1 and P2 is:

$$
S = (P_1, P_2, \phi)
$$

where \phi is a binding morphism.

### Properties

1. Transitivity:

$$
\text{if } S_{12} \text{ and } S_{23} \text{ then } S_{13}
$$

2. Self-Synchronization:

$$
\exists S: P \to P
$$

## Implementation in Julia

Our implementation follows these mathematical foundations:

```julia
# Category implementation
struct Category
    objects::Vector{String}
    morphisms::Vector{Tuple{String, String, String}}
end

# Pattern implementation
struct Pattern
    objects::Vector{String}
    morphisms::Vector{Tuple{String, String, String}}
end

# Memory System implementation
struct MemorySystem
    category::Category
    memory::Dict{String, Any}
    procedures::Vector{Function}
end

# Synchronization implementation
struct Synchronization
    pattern1::Pattern
    pattern2::Pattern
    morphism::Tuple{String, String, String}
end
```

## Applications

### 1. Neural Networks
From the 2007 book, Chapter 9 (MENS):

```julia
# Neural network category
nn_cat = Category(
    ["Input", "Hidden", "Output"],
    [
        ("Input", "Hidden", "weights1"),
        ("Hidden", "Output", "weights2")
    ]
)

# Neural network pattern
nn_pattern = Pattern(
    ["Input", "Hidden", "Output"],
    [
        ("Input", "Hidden", "weights1"),
        ("Hidden", "Output", "weights2")
    ]
)
```

### 2. Social Networks
From the 2023 paper:

```julia
# Social network category
social_cat = Category(
    ["User", "Post", "Comment"],
    [
        ("User", "Post", "creates"),
        ("Post", "Comment", "has"),
        ("User", "Comment", "writes")
    ]
)

# Social network pattern
social_pattern = Pattern(
    ["User", "Post", "Comment"],
    [
        ("User", "Post", "creates"),
        ("Post", "Comment", "has")
    ]
)
```
