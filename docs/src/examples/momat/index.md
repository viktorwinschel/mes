# MOMAT Examples

This section contains examples of using MES for Monetary Macro Accounting (MOMAT) modeling. These examples demonstrate how to apply the Memory Evolutive Systems framework to model monetary and financial systems.

## Basic Examples

- [Simple Monetary Circuit](basic.md) - Basic example of modeling a simple monetary circuit
- [Bank Balance Sheets](basic.md#bank-balance-sheets) - Modeling bank balance sheets and their evolution
- [Payment Systems](basic.md#payment-systems) - Modeling payment system interactions

## Advanced Examples

- [Complex Financial Networks](advanced.md) - Modeling complex financial networks with multiple banks
- [Systemic Risk Analysis](advanced.md#systemic-risk) - Analyzing systemic risk in financial networks
- [Monetary Policy Effects](advanced.md#monetary-policy) - Modeling the effects of monetary policy

## Theory

The MOMAT examples are based on the following theoretical foundations:

1. **Monetary Circuit Theory**
   - Bank money creation
   - Payment system dynamics
   - Balance sheet constraints

2. **Network Theory**
   - Interbank networks
   - Payment flows
   - Systemic risk

3. **Memory Systems**
   - Financial memory
   - Credit history
   - Market expectations
