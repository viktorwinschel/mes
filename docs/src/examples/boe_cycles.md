# Bill of Exchange (BOE) Cycles

This example demonstrates how Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) can model financial instruments and their circulation using category theory. We focus on Bills of Exchange (BOE), a historical and still relevant form of trade finance.

## Historical Context

The bill of exchange market has a rich history and significant modern relevance:
- Historical bill market in Germany 1990: 50 Billion DM per annum, demonstrating the scale of traditional trade finance
- Current trade finance market: $\sim 10^{12}$, with 2/3 as open account (deferred payment), showing evolution to modern forms

## Mathematical Framework

### 1. Categorical Structure

The system is modeled using three levels of categories:

#### Micro Level (Individual Transactions)
Objects:
- Agents: `Seller`, `Buyer`, `Seller_Bank`, `Buyer_Bank` - The primary participants in BOE transactions
- Accounts: `Seller_Inventory`, `Buyer_Inventory`, `Seller_Receivables`, `Buyer_Liabilities` - Balance sheet accounts tracking assets and obligations

Morphisms:
- Physical: `Physical_Transfer` - Represents actual movement of goods between parties
- Financial: 
  * `Create_BOE` - Initial issuance of the bill
  * `Record_BOE` - Accounting entry creation
  * `Transfer_BOE` - Change in bill ownership
  * `Interbank_Transfer` - Settlement between banks
  * `Final_Transfer` - Maturity payment

#### Meso Level (Banking System)
Objects:
- System Components:
  * `Banking_Network` - Interconnected financial institutions
  * `Clearing_System` - Infrastructure for processing transactions
  * `Bank_Positions` - Net exposures and balances
  * `Settlement_Accounts` - Accounts for final settlement

Morphisms:
- Settlement:
  * `Settlement_Process` - Clearing and netting of transactions
  * `Position_Update` - Adjustment of bank balances

#### Macro Level (Economic System)
Objects:
- System Components:
  * `Economy` - Overall economic system
  * `Monetary_System` - Money creation and circulation
  * `National_Accounts` - Aggregate economic measures
  * `Reserve_System` - Central bank operations

Morphisms:
- Adjustments:
  * `Reserve_Adjustment` - Changes in monetary policy
  * `Economic_Update` - Macroeconomic effects

### 2. Present Value Calculations

The present value of a Bill of Exchange is calculated using the standard discounting formula:

$PV = \frac{FV}{1 + r \cdot t}$

Key Components:
- Present Value ($PV$): The current worth of a future payment, representing the amount a bank would pay today
- Face Value ($FV$): The final payment amount at maturity, typically the full commercial value
- Discount Rate ($r$): The annualized interest rate used for discounting, reflecting:
  * Base interest rate in the economy
  * Credit risk of the parties involved
  * Market liquidity conditions
  * Term premium for longer maturities
- Time to Maturity ($t$): The period until final payment, expressed in years, affecting:
  * Duration of credit exposure
  * Liquidity premium
  * Risk assessment
  * Capital requirements

Practical Implications:
- Higher discount rates reduce present value, reflecting increased risk or opportunity cost
- Longer maturities increase the discount effect, showing time value of money
- Credit quality affects the discount rate, linking to risk assessment
- Market conditions influence valuation through the discount rate

### 3. Transaction Structure

Each transaction is represented as a structure with:
- Unique identifier
- Timestamp
- Description
- Amount
- Source and target accounts
- Discount rate
- Maturity date
- Present value

## Implementation Details

### 1. Transaction Flow

The BOE lifecycle consists of four main stages:

1. **BOE Creation**
   ```julia
   # Initial BOE issuance
   pv = calculate_present_value(initial_amount, rate, maturity_months/12)
   ```

2. **Bank Acceptance**
   ```julia
   # Bank accepts BOE with discount
   discount = calculate_discount(initial_amount, pv)
   ```

3. **Monthly Transfers**
   ```julia
   # Regular payments over maturity period
   transfer_amount = initial_amount / maturity_months
   current_pv = calculate_present_value(transfer_amount, rate, remaining_time)
   ```

4. **Final Settlement**
   ```julia
   # Final payment at maturity
   final_amount = initial_amount
   ```

### 2. Categorical Relationships

The system maintains several key categorical relationships:

1. **Composition**
   - Micro → Meso: Individual transactions compose to form banking system states
   - Meso → Macro: Banking activities compose to form economic indicators

2. **Functors**
   - Transaction recording: Maps physical transfers to financial records
   - Settlement: Maps individual transactions to net positions

3. **Natural Transformations**
   - Value adjustments over time
   - Risk transformations between different levels

## Example Usage

```julia
# Create the multi-level system
micro, meso, macro = bill_of_exchange_example()

# Run a BOE transaction sequence
log = run_boe_example(
    initial_amount=10000.0,
    rate=0.05,
    maturity_months=6
)
```

## Mathematical Properties

The system maintains several invariants:

1. **Conservation of Value**
   - Micro level: Double-entry bookkeeping ensures $\text{Debit} = \text{Credit}$
   - Meso level: Net positions sum to zero
   - Macro level: Flow consistency in national accounts

2. **Temporal Structure**
   - Present value calculations form a functor from the time category to the value category
   - Discount rates define natural transformations between different temporal perspectives

3. **Categorical Invariants**
   - Composition closure at each level
   - Identity morphisms for account states
   - Associativity of transaction composition

## Applications

This categorical approach to BOE modeling has several practical applications:

1. **Risk Analysis**
   - Track propagation of defaults through the banking network
   - Analyze systemic risk at different levels

2. **Efficiency Metrics**
   - Measure clearing efficiency in the banking system
   - Evaluate economic impact of trade finance

3. **Policy Analysis**
   - Study effects of discount rate changes
   - Analyze impact of regulatory changes on system behavior
