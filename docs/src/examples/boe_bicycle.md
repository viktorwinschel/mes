# BOE Bicycle Example: Categorical Constructions

This example demonstrates how the BOE (Bill of Exchange) bicycle trade illustrates key categorical constructions in accounting.

## 1. Overview

A bicycle dealer sells a bicycle to a customer, who pays with a BOE. The dealer then discounts the BOE at a bank. This example shows:

1. Micro balance through pullbacks
2. Macro balance through pushouts
3. Memory generation of possibilities
4. Categorical structure of money emergence

## 2. Categorical Constructions

### 2.1 Pullbacks (Micro Balance)

Each account must balance internally through a pullback:

```
Debit ←-- Account --→ Credit
  ↓                     ↓
Amount ←---------- Amount
```

Example in bicycle sale:
```julia
# Bike Dealer's Inventory Account
pullback = TAccountPullback(
    100.0,  # Debit (decrease inventory)
    100.0,  # Credit (sale)
    "Inventory"
)

# Customer's BOE Account
pullback = TAccountPullback(
    0.0,    # Debit
    100.0,  # Credit (BOE liability)
    "BOE Liability"
)
```

### 2.2 Pushouts (Macro Balance)

Agents must be imbalanced together through pushouts:

```
BikeDealer --→ BOE Relationship ←-- Customer
    ↓                                 ↓
Receivable ----------------→ Liability
```

Example in BOE creation:
```julia
pushout = DebtPushout(
    "BikeDealer",        # Creditor
    "Customer",          # Debtor
    "BOE Relationship",
    100.0               # Amount
)
```

### 2.3 Memory Generation

When booking the bicycle sale:

1. Initial debit (Dealer's inventory):
```julia
update_account!(dealer.accounts["Inventory"], 
    -100.0, "debit", date)
```

2. Memory generates possible credits:
```julia
possible_credits = [
    # Direct sale for cash
    Dict("account" => "Cash", "amount" => 100.0),
    
    # BOE payment
    Dict("account" => "BOE Receivable", "amount" => 100.0),
    
    # Bank transfer
    Dict("account" => "Bank Deposits", "amount" => 100.0)
]
```

3. Each possibility must satisfy:
   - Pullback condition (account balance)
   - Pushout condition (valid relationship)

## 3. BOE Lifecycle

### 3.1 Creation

1. Bicycle Sale:
   - Pullback: Dealer's inventory account
   - Pushout: Trade relationship

2. BOE Issue:
   - Pullback: Customer's BOE liability
   - Pushout: BOE relationship

### 3.2 Discounting

1. Bank takes BOE:
   - New pullback: Bank's BOE receivable
   - New pushout: Bank-Customer relationship

2. Money Creation:
   - BOE becomes money through categorical binding
   - Multiple resolution paths possible

### 3.3 Settlement

1. Customer pays:
   - Resolves pullbacks (accounts clear)
   - Dissolves pushout (relationship settles)

2. Money Destruction:
   - BOE pattern dissolves
   - System returns to coherent state

## 4. Implementation

The categorical structure is implemented in three main components:

1. **Account Structure**:
```julia
struct Account
    debit::Float64
    credit::Float64
    name::String
    transactions::Vector{Dict}
end
```

2. **Categorical Verification**:
```julia
function verify_micro_pullback(account::Account)
    # Check internal balance
    return account.debit == account.credit
end

function verify_macro_pushout(landscape::MOMALandscape, 
                            relationship::String)
    # Check relationship balance
    return debits_match_credits(relationship)
end
```

3. **Memory Generation**:
```julia
function generate_possibilities(debit::Dict)
    # Generate valid credit possibilities
    return filter(verify_categorical_balance, 
                 possible_credits)
end
```

## 5. Testing

The categorical structure is verified through tests:

```julia
@testset "BOE Bicycle Example" begin
    # Test pullbacks
    @test verify_micro_pullback(dealer_account)
    @test verify_micro_pullback(customer_account)
    
    # Test pushouts
    @test verify_macro_pushout(landscape, boe_relationship)
    
    # Test money emergence
    @test detect_money_emergence(landscape)
end
```

## 6. Mathematical Properties

The example demonstrates key categorical properties:

1. **Universal Property of Pullbacks**:
   - Any balanced account factors through pullback
   - Ensures unique balance resolution

2. **Universal Property of Pushouts**:
   - Any valid relationship factors through pushout
   - Ensures consistent debt relationships

3. **Functorial Evolution**:
   - BOE transfers preserve categorical structure
   - Settlement resolves structure coherently

4. **Emergence Through Binding**:
   - Money emerges from categorical binding
   - Multiple micro states yield same macro state
