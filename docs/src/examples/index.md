# Examples Overview

This section contains detailed examples of using Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) in economic and financial contexts.

## Bill of Exchange (BOE) Cycles
A focused example demonstrating how MES can model financial instruments and their circulation using category theory. This example shows the power of categorical modeling in representing complex financial relationships at multiple scales.

## National Accounting System
A comprehensive example showing how MES can be used to model an entire national accounting system, including multiple economic agents, their interactions, and the resulting economic flows.

## Example Categories

Our examples cover several key areas:

1. **Financial Instruments**
   - Credit relationships
   - Payment systems
   - Settlement processes
   - Bill of Exchange modeling
   - Transaction networks
   - Temporal evolution

2. **Economic Systems**
   - Flow modeling
   - Balance sheets
   - Multi-level accounting structures
   - System-wide invariants
   - Economic agent interactions

## Example Structure

Each example follows a consistent structure:

1. **Theoretical Background**
   - Relevant mathematical concepts
   - System requirements
   - Modeling assumptions

2. **Implementation**
   - Code structure
   - Key functions
   - Data types
   - Algorithms

3. **Results**
   - System behavior
   - Visualizations
   - Analysis
   - Interpretation

## Getting Started

For those new to MES, we recommend following this sequence:

1. Start with the [Bill of Exchange](boe_cycles.md) example for a focused introduction
2. Move on to the [National Accounting](national_accounting.md) example for comprehensive economic modeling
