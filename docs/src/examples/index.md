# Examples Overview

This section provides practical examples of using Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) to model various systems. Each example demonstrates different aspects of the framework and its applications.

## Available Examples

1. **Basic Examples**
   - Introduction to category theory concepts
   - Simple memory system implementations
   - Basic synchronization patterns

2. **National Accounting**
   - Economic flow modeling
   - Multi-level accounting structures
   - System-wide invariants
   - Balance sheet relationships

3. **Bill of Exchange**
   - Financial instrument modeling
   - Transaction networks
   - Temporal evolution
   - Multi-level invariance

## Example Structure

Each example follows a consistent structure:

1. **Theoretical Background**
   - Relevant mathematical concepts
   - System requirements
   - Modeling assumptions

2. **Implementation**
   - Code structure
   - Key functions
   - Data types
   - Algorithms

3. **Results**
   - System behavior
   - Visualizations
   - Analysis
   - Interpretation

## Getting Started

For those new to MES, we recommend following this sequence:

1. Start with the [Basic Examples](../examples.md) to understand fundamental concepts
2. Move on to the [National Accounting](national_accounting.md) example for economic applications
3. Explore the [Bill of Exchange](boe_cycles.md) example for financial modeling

## Example Categories
