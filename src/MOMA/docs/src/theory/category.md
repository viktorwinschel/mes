# Category Theory Framework

MOMA uses category theory to model financial events and analyze monetary systems. This page explains the key categorical concepts and their financial interpretations.

## Basic Concepts

### Objects

In MOMA, objects represent financial accounts. Each account has:
- An agent (e.g., Central Bank, Commercial Bank)
- An account type (e.g., Deposits, Loans)
- A classification (Asset or Liability)

```julia
# Example: Central Bank's paper money account
cb_paper = create_account_object("CB", "PaperMoney", Asset())
```

### Morphisms

Morphisms represent money flows between accounts. Each morphism has:
- A source account (where money flows from)
- A target account (where money flows to)
- An amount
- A date

```julia
# Example: Money flowing from CB paper money to circulation
flow = create_morphism(cb_paper, cb_circulation, 1000.0, date)
```

### Composition

Morphisms can be composed to represent sequential money transfers. The composition preserves:
- Source from the first morphism
- Target from the second morphism
- Amount from the first morphism (for non-identity morphisms)

```julia
# Example: Composing two money flows
m1 = create_morphism(a, b, 1000.0, date)
m2 = create_morphism(b, c, 2000.0, date)
composed = compose_morphisms(m1, m2)  # Flow from a to c with amount 1000.0
```

## Diagrams

Diagrams represent financial events by combining objects and morphisms. MOMA ensures:
- Commutativity: Consistency of flows
- Well-defined structure: Valid source/target relationships

```julia
# Example: Money creation diagram
diagram = create_money_creation_diagram(1000.0, date)
@assert is_commutative(diagram)
```

## Colimits

Colimits capture the system-wide effect of local transfers. The colimit construction:
1. Creates a "system balance" object
2. Maps each account to this object
3. Preserves the flow structure

```julia
# Example: Creating and verifying a colimit
colimit = create_colimit(diagram)
@assert verify_universal_property(colimit)
```

The universal property ensures that:
- Source objects contribute their outflow
- Target objects contribute their inflow
- Intermediary objects have no net effect

## Mathematical Properties

MOMA enforces several important categorical properties:

1. **Identity Laws**:
   ```julia
   # id ∘ f = f = f ∘ id
   id_morph = create_morphism(a, a, 0.0, date)
   @assert compose_morphisms(id_morph, f).amount == f.amount
   ```

2. **Associativity**:
   ```julia
   # (h ∘ g) ∘ f = h ∘ (g ∘ f)
   comp1 = compose_morphisms(compose_morphisms(h, g), f)
   comp2 = compose_morphisms(h, compose_morphisms(g, f))
   @assert comp1.amount == comp2.amount
   ```

3. **Diagram Commutativity**:
   ```julia
   # All paths between same objects must agree
   @assert is_commutative(diagram)
   ```

4. **Universal Property**:
   ```julia
   # Colimit captures global effects consistently
   @assert verify_universal_property(create_colimit(diagram))
   ```
