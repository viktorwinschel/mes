"""
This module implements the event-based dynamics of Memory Evolutive Systems (MES)
as described in Ehresmann & Vanbremeersch (2007).

Key concepts:
- Event sequences and their composition
- Memory dynamics and evolution
- Pattern binding and emergence
- Hierarchical complexification

See `docs/src/theory/mes07_formulas.md` for detailed mathematical formulas.

Memory in MOMA actively generates financial data through event processing:
1. Each event creates new account states (micro memory)
2. These combine to form system-wide patterns (macro memory)
3. Memory evolution tracks both states and their relationships
