# Memory Evolutive Systems (MES)

A Julia package for modeling complex systems using category theory, focusing on hierarchy, emergence, and evolution.

## Overview

Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) provide a mathematical framework for modeling complex systems that:
- Develop hierarchical structures
- Exhibit emergent properties
- Evolve over time through interactions
- Form and utilize memory

## Documentation

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("MES")
```

## Quick Start

```julia
using MES

# Create a simple category
cat = create_category([
    ("A", "B", "f"),
    ("B", "C", "g")
])

# Create a pattern
pattern = create_pattern([
    ("A", "B", "f")
])

# Calculate a colimit
colimit = calculate_colimit(pattern)
```

## Features

- **Category Theory Foundations**: Implementation of categories, functors, and natural transformations
- **Pattern Recognition**: Tools for identifying and working with patterns in complex systems
- **Colimit Calculations**: Mechanisms for binding and integration
- **Hierarchical Structures**: Support for multi-level system modeling
- **Evolution Tracking**: Tools for modeling system changes over time
- **Memory Modeling**: Frameworks for representing and utilizing system memory
